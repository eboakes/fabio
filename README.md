# FABIO
### The Food and Agriculture Biomass Input-Output database

FABIO provides a set of multi-regional physical supply-use and input-output tables covering global agriculture and forestry. The work is based on mostly freely available data from FAOSTAT, IEA, EIA, and UN Comtrade/BACI. FABIO currently covers 192 countries, 121 processes and 130 commodities for 1986-2013.

### License

This repository provides all scripts and auxiliary data, which are distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 3. It is free to run, study, share and modify all versions of FABIO (using proper citation) and I'd like to invite scholars, footprint practitioners and businesses likewise to download and use the data. In case you are interested in a collaboration, I am happy to receive enquiries at <martin.bruckner@wu.ac.at>.

### Reproducibility

Due to changes in the structure of the data sets provided by FAOSTAT after these scripts were written, they currently cannot be run. We are revising the code and will pulish it here in September 2019.  

### Database

The FABIO database will be available once the above mentioned manuscript is published. Please see http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2577067.
